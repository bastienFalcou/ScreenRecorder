  ScreenRecorder can record a video of your screen and save the output file locally on any iOS version:
  - Record video of your screen on any iOS version
  - Save video locally and consult previous videos for further reuse (upload video to server, see video on the phone, etc.)
  - Easily create your "stop recording" button that although seen on screen, will not be recorded in the video
